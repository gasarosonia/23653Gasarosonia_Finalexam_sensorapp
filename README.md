Features and Components:
1. Light Level Sensing and Automation
a. Use the device's ambient light sensor to measure the brightness level in the surroundings.
b. Implement automation features such as adjusting smart lights or notifying users based on 
changes in ambient light levels.
2. Motion Detection and Security
a. Integrate the device's accelerometer sensor to detect motion or vibrations.
b. Implement a motion detection feature that triggers notifications or alerts when unexpected 
movements are detected 
3. Location Tracking and Geofencing
a. Implement location tracking to monitor the movement of the device within specified 
geographical boundaries (geofencing).
b. Use GPS data to trigger actions or notifications when the device enters or exits predefined areas 
(e.g., home, work).
4. User Interface and Alerts
a. Design an intuitive user interface that displays sensor data in real-time using charts or visual 
indicators.
b. Implement push notifications or alerts to notify users of significant changes (e.g. motion 
detected).
